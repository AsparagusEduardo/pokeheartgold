# Is pokeheartgold usable?

No, pokeheartgold is only partially usable.

## What does "usable" entail?

The repository becomes usable when you can
1) Edit the C code without breaking the entire game
2) Change any asset with native tools

The repository becomes complete when
1) All code is translated to C
2) All data are exported to a source format, be it text or binary
3) Nintendo libraries and headers can be hotswapped in (allowing full access to available hardware features)
